I am an old new coder. I said "old" because of my age and "new" for that I just started to learn how to code seriously. I have been dreaming to be a good coder for years but I never dived into any computer language. Couples of days ago, I realized that the time never waited for us and we need to do something interesting in our life so that I decided to start my journey in coding. Hope that I can grow my skills of coding in this web.
